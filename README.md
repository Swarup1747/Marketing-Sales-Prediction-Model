# Sales Prediction using Marketing Spends (KNIME + ML)

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to **predict sales** based on **marketing expenditures** across various channels like TV, radio, and newspapers. The workflow is built using **KNIME Analytics Platform**.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict product sales based on the amount spent on different advertising media.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
- **Platform**: KNIME Analytics Platform  
- **Language**: Visual Workflow (no-code/low-code via KNIME)  
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor (optional)  
- **Visualization**: KNIME's built-in chart and plot nodes
